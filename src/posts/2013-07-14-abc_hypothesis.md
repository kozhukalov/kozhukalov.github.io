title: Shinichi Mochizuki proved ABC-hypothesis
summary: At the late August 2012 Shinichi Mochizuki published series of four papers where he claimed that he proved ABC-hypothesis. His papers are so complicated that extreamly small number of people around the world who supposed to be able to understand his work. But at the same time if his proof is correct it could be the most important mathematical achivement since 1993 when the Fermat's Last Theorem was proved.

At the late August 2012 Shinichi Mochizuki published series of four papers where he claimed that he proved ABC-hypothesis. His papers are so complicated that extreamly small number of people around the world who supposed to be able to understand his work. But at the same time if his proof is correct it could be the most important mathematical achivement since 1993 when the Fermat's Last Theorem was proved.
Here are the links to his series of four papers
