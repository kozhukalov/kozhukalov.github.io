title: What is ROS?
summary: ROS is a quite new initiative about robotics. It is Robot Operating System. Actually it is not an operating system in a sense we usually think of that. Currently, it is just a bunch of robotics related software projects which are developed by various contributors both individuals and organizations. Most of those projects are open source, so anyone can take part in developing ROS.

My current interest about ROS is quite shallow.
